<h1> SCHOOL FRIENDS</h1>
<p class="pa">

  My best friend is someone special whom I can share my all feelings. He is Raghav. He lives with me as my neighbour in the same colony.<br> We met each other in the nursery class on the very first day. We sit together in the classroom and share everything very happily without any problem.<br><br> We know each other very well as well as understand each otherâ€™s need. He is leadership in nature, tall, fair in complexion, good looking and smart.<br> She is very good in studies and behaves well with everyone. He does his class work and homework very attentively.<br> <br>He is favourite student of class teacher as he is very punctual and follows all the etiquettes.<br>
  We share our Tiffin in the lunch time. He respects my feelings and helps me always. Many things of us like hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc are similar. <br><br>We love to listen music, watching cartoons and playing carom at home. We take care of each other in the school and playground.<br> We share school copies and help each other whenever one of us remain absent in the school. We love drawing sceneries and arts in our spare time.<br><br> We go at tour and picnic with our parents together in every winter and summer vacation.<br>

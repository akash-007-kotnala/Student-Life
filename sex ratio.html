    There are always many more boys than girls in your college. The worst sex ratio ever.<br><br>
    But that pretty much means girls get extra attention from guys all the time.<br>
    And if you’re a girl in the mechanical branch, you are treated as nothing less than a celebrity.<br>
<br>
  And for boys its matter of compition.<br>
 Boys(Poor fellows) they can see so many people(boys) around them but didn’t find out girls.<br><br>
